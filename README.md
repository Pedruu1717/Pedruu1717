### 🔭 I’ve worked as:

  ### Frontend Web Developer at Connexall:
  
  Responsibilities:

  - Develop and maintain company websites in relation to the front-end layer with a special focus on the Vue.js framework

  - Develop a video call web application known as MobileConnex. This application allows doctors and nurses to communicate via video call and also receive alarm notifications that sound on certain hospital devices,      such as a low oxygen alert or a warning that a patient has fallen out of bed, among others.

  - Responsible for programming the communications made in video calls and also for the visual part of the application.

  - Responsible for updating the server whenever a new version of the application is developed.

  - Responsible for collaborating with other members of the front-end, back-end and design teams, and also for participating in meetings aimed at presenting what has been done and analysing what can be done to          improve the application.
